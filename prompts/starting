We are building a personal research and curation app called Fieldnotes.

Purpose:
Fieldnotes is for gathering, annotating, and connecting historical and cultural evidence.
It is not a wiki, not a feed, and not a social network.
It is a private working notebook for serious curiosity.

Core metaphor:
A field of people, places, and events that briefly intersect.
Events matter because they bring entities together at a specific time and place.

Initial scope:
Stage 1 focuses on Soho, London, mid-1960s.
We start with music clubs and gigs (e.g. the Marquee, Polytechnic shows).
Information will be incomplete, contradictory, and source-dependent.

Principles:
- Evidence-first: every factual claim should be traceable to a source.
- Ambiguity is allowed and should be preserved, not prematurely resolved.
- Events are central; people and venues orbit events.
- YouTube is a first-class source for music and performance.
- The system should support gradual refinement over time.

Tech constraints:
- Next.js (default setup)
- SQLite for now
- Simple, explicit data models over clever abstractions

What we want first:
Help define an event-centric data model suitable for messy early-stage research,
and guide the creation of the first few historical events without overfitting.

Assume this project will grow slowly and be thought with, not optimized yet.
