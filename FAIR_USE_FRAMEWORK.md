# Fair Use Framework for Fieldnotes Documentary

## Legal Position

This project uses short excerpts of musical recordings for **educational purposes**, **purposes of criticism**, and to provide **commentary** on historical performances and cultural context. We believe this constitutes fair use under US copyright law (17 U.S.C. § 107) and equivalent provisions in other jurisdictions.

## Fair Use Factors Analysis

### 1. Purpose and Character of Use
- **Educational**: Documenting historical music venues and performances
- **Transformative**: Clips integrated into broader historical narrative
- **Non-commercial**: [Update based on your intended use]
- **Commentary/Criticism**: Musical and cultural analysis of performances

### 2. Nature of Copyrighted Work
- Published musical recordings
- Highly creative works (weighs against fair use)
- Historical/archival significance (weighs for fair use)

### 3. Amount and Substantiality Used
- **Maximum clip length**: 5-15 seconds (typically < 3% of original)
- **Necessity test**: Only as much as needed to illustrate specific point
- **Not the "heart"**: Avoid using the most commercially valuable portions

### 4. Effect on Market Value
- **No substitution**: Clips too short to replace purchase of full recordings
- **Market enhancement**: Provides historical context and links to purchase
- **Educational value**: Increases appreciation and potential sales

## Implementation Guidelines

### Music Clip Requirements

Every music excerpt MUST:

1. **Be Brief**
   - Maximum 15 seconds per clip
   - Multiple clips from same work must not exceed 30 seconds total
   - Prefer 5-10 second excerpts when possible

2. **Serve Educational Purpose**
   - Tied to specific historical moment, venue, or performance
   - Accompanied by contextual information
   - Part of larger transformative narrative

3. **Include Attribution**
   ```
   Track: [Song Title]
   Artist: [Artist Name]
   Album: [Album Name]

   ```

4. **Provide Purchase Links**
   - Link to Spotify, Apple Music, or other streaming services
   - Link to purchase options where available
   - Encourage supporting the artists and rights holders

### Two-Tier Music System

#### Tier 1: Spotify Preview Clips (Legally Clear)

#### Tier 2: Fair Use Clips (Requires Justification)

- Must have clear commentary/criticism purpose
- Document reasoning for each use

## Documentation Requirements

For each fair use clip, document:

1. **Clip identifier**: Unique ID in database
2. **Duration**: Exact length in seconds
3. **Educational purpose**: Specific reason for inclusion
4. **Contextual narrative**: How it fits into larger story
5. **Commentary provided**: What insight/analysis accompanies it
6. **Alternatives considered**: Why this clip is necessary
